// This sample demonstrates an API by which the size of the threadpool owned by
// a Framework object can be controlled. It can be used as the basis for a custom
// control scheme to manage the number of threads active in the Framework's
// threadpool in software at runtime. See the MeasuringThreadUtilizatio sample for
// a demonstration of a related API by which your application can measure the degree
// to which the existing threads in the threadpool are being utilitized, and hence
// decide whether to add or remove threads. See also the ManagingTheThreadpool demo
// for an example of a custom threadpool management scheme implemented as an actor.

    // rather than a single method to directly set the actual number of threads, is to allow
    // negotiation between multiple agents, each with a different interest in the thread count.

    // the actual number of threads is higher, while another may wish to impose a maximum limit
    // on the number of threads in existance, but be satisfied if there are less. If two calls
    // specify different minimums, the greater takes effect. Likewise if two maximums are
    // specified, the lower is effective. If conflicting minimum and maximums are specified

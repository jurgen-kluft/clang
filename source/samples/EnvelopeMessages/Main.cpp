// This sample demonstrates the use of 'envelope' (or 'proxy') messages that are
// just lightweight references to owned objects. The message is copyable, but the
// referenced object is not copied when the message is copied. Instead just the reference
// is copied. This allows heavyweight objects, whose copying is expensive, to be safely
// sent in messages without introducing shared memory, by senging lightweight references
// to them instead.
//
// Additionally, the envelope message imposes the single ownership of the referenced object
// (and the uniqueness of the reference), such that only one of the copies of the envelope
// actually contains a valid reference to the 'letter' object at any time. This ensures that
// once the sender has sent a message, the recipient can access it but the sender can not.
// This feature is important for preserving the semantics of the actor model. If we
// simply sent a raw pointer to the referenced object as a message instead, there would be
// nothing stopping the sender from dereferencing the pointer after sending it, introducing
// the possibility of shared memory (and related thread synchronization issues that the
// Actor Model, if used correctly, solves). The simplest way to prevent this is to always
// send actual copies of objects in messages, allowing the entire object to be deep-copied
// in memory. However this can be expensive, for heavyweight objects. Instead, envelope
// messages provide the semantics of single-ownership without the copying overhead.
//
// Note that the envelope class template provided here is a simplified implementation and
// shows just the basics (although it works well enough, for objects that don't require
// specialized construction). It is similar in concept to well-known standard idioms such
// as smart pointers (eg. auto_ptr and unique_ptr), which are more general and better
// developed. Use one of those implementations instead (for example the ones in Boost),
// if they suit your application. The point of this example is to explain the concept.
